     <h1>Benefits of Yoga </h1>
    <p> If we look at the history, we see that Yoga originated in India. This ancient practice began when various yogis started performing yoga. 
Yoga translates to union and discipline and is derived from the Sanskrit language. The religious followers of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism used to practice it in the earlier days.
    It helps in keeping our mental and physical health intact. It helps us to connect to nature. 
  Furthermore, your body becomes more flexible after consistent yoga practice and you also develop a
 great sense of self-discipline and self-awareness.
   In short, it improves our well-being and gives us better mental clarity.</p>
